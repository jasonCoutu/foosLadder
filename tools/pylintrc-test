# W0703: catch Exception: is valid in python2.5
# W0511: TODO: FIXME: are valid tags that don't need a failure
# I0011: disable the 'Locally disabling W1234' messages - makes failures easier to track down
# I0013: disable the 'Ignoring entire file' messages - makes failures easier to track down
# R0201: sometime we just want to use methods instead of functions, even if 'self' is not accessed
# R0921: Abstract class not referenced.
# R0922: we're building things iteratively, so it's OK if an abstract base class is only inherited once
# W0142: * or ** magic is fine - it's well documented non-magic
# R0801: duplicate code checker
# E1101: '%s %r has no %r member'
# E1103: Instance of 'X' has no member 'X' (but some types could not be inferred)
# R0904: Too many public methods. This apparently happens quite easily with test classes inheriting from each other.
