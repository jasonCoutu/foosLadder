Tennis Ladder Scoring is computed by the 39 point system scoring system:

This system is the based on the classic Leap Frog system, but awards points to the winner and loser.  When you win a player/team, you take their position on the ladder.  This system not only awards the winners, but it awards the losers as well.  This encourages players to play matches to maintain their ladder ranking.  The number 39 represents the maximum number of games that could be played in a match (7-6,6-7,7-6). Here is how it works:

1. If the winner is the higher ranked player/team they receives 39 points minus the number of games the loser won added to there current points.
2. If the winner is the lower ranked player/team, their previous point value is replaced by the value of his opponent's points plus an additional 39 points minus the number of games the loser won.
3. The losers always receives 1 point for each game that he wins.

Example 1:
Jane beats John 6-3, 6-2
Jane had 42 points, John had 56 points
Jane now has 56 + 39 - 5 = 90 points
John now has 56 + 5 = 61 points

Example 2:
Jane beats John 6-4, 6-4
Jane had 40 points, John had 32 points
Jane now has 40 + 39 - 8 = 71 points
John now has 32 + 8 = 40 points
